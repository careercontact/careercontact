              She always knew that she was strong in writing, she did well in written assignments in school, but never really had a keen interest in journalism. Later when she went to polytechnic, she picked up communications because she wanted to use her strength in languages and had an interest in corporate communications. She realised a keen interest during her unpaid internship in Cosmopolitan Magazine, despite being tasked with menial work, she found herself really energized by the environment and the media scene like going to photoshoots etc.

            <p>
              At the start it was just about seeing her name beside the byline and feeling validated by the fact that her articles were good enough to be published. Gradually, she found meaning in being able to tell other's stories and get the audience to think about other's lives and the issues around them more deeply.

          <div id="faq3" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
            Yes there is definitely room for political journalism, in fact, it is even easier to enter into political journalism than investigative journalism. But don't expect to be able to write expose on government corruption.

          <div id="faq4" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
            It's perfectly okay, she has many friends who do it and she says this is a low maintenance way of writing BUT she says that discipline is very important because when journalism is not your full time job it's hard to find the motivation to put in the work.

          <div id="faq5" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
            As a 17 year old, don't think that you cannot contribute anything, because as a 17 year old, there are perspectives on things that you can give that a millennial writer would not be able to (for eg tiktok, latest trends). What you can do is to pitch your ideas to Rice, Mothership, TSL, Mustsharenews, Straits Times etc, look up the editors online and find all the ways that you can possibly pitch it.

          <div id="faq6" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
            Not in her experience. But there was a time she was taken off an article about Singapore politics as her editors felt like an older writer with a more established career should take over. She says this is something she felt strongly about as she does not believe that just because someone is older means that they should be able to tell you what to do.

            She says she had a lot of creative freedom in Rice but CNA is more hierarchical but she says that the boundaries she is given in CNA have made her a better writer (because with no boundaries you are all over the place). She feels that she writes sharper now in CNA as whatever writing she puts out will have to go through all these levels of editing.

            She applied for a job as a digital writer at Cleo magazine, that was her first job. That is the only job that she got through application, the rest of the jobs were through referrals. She says it's important for all aspiring journalists to realise how important networking is in the industry because that's how you get opportunities, esp because this industry is quite closed off (very exclusive). She advices aspiring journalists to get a good mentor, and just reach out to them on Linkedin or email them to ask if it's okay to pick their brain, but must make sure to go to them with specific questions, make it easy to be mentored. She thinks it's much easier to enter the industry with a mentor because there will be someone that can vouch for your writing.

            She thinks it's bad journalism, the arguments were very loose, she didn't even have the right word, the right word is "identity politics", a phenomenon where you judge someone solely their identity (eg like cannot talk about minority issues just bc I'm from the majority race). Grace feels the writer based her article on a very small but loud group of minorities, the very liberal and progressive social activists. In general the issue about identity politics, which Grace thinks the author isn't able to put across, is shaming people for not being as aware about their privilege etc, which puts people off finding out more. Grace disagrees with the author's opinion that people nowadays aren't able to put forth their opinion because Grace feels if you ask others questions to learn more, in a tactful and sensitive manner, people will be happy to answer. The examples the author gave were not the correct examples at all, she gave the example of transphobia, but Grace feels that it's just completely wrong because the context is different. Grace says that it doesn't matter if the intention of a piece is good or not because in journalism the intention doesn't matter as much as the impact (and Grace thinks the impact was disastrous). She feels bad for the writer. Grace thinks that young writers don't consider hard enough the implications of their writing being put out there and in the author's case this will follow her forever.

          <div id="faq10" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
            *Grace goes off-topic and talks about her own experience. She went viral for writing her expose on Eden Ang. The process of writing the article took a lot of effort from interviewing the victims (the victims never even talked to it to their friends and family members and only spoke on account of anonymity), she verified the article through screenshots and corroboration of police reports. This was her first piece to go so viral and she never expected this impact. As a writer, she thinks it doesn't feel right for her name and her byline to be tagged to taking someone down, even when Eden did something wrong. She thinks that as a young writer she would have appreciated someone telling her the true implications that writing such a piece would have on the rest of her career. She is happy that the victims had a platform to tell their story and speak out, but at the same time, she felt guilt for writing such a piece that "destroyed his career" although she knows that he destroyed his own career with his own mistakes. She says this is important for all young journalists to know the pitfalls of writing controversial stories. On this same article, she also learnt that she was not trained to handle interviewees with trauma. She says it's important to understand in trauma reporting people really need to understand how someone's trauma might affect the way you tell your story and the way they carry themselves (they might experience trauma in a way that distorts their memory or puts them across in a way that makes them appear untrustworthy) and she was not trained to deal with that because she isn't a psychologist. She was also afraid to mention events in case it was triggering to the victims but at the same time she needed them to be honest with her. She felt that she was in a catch 22 situation, she was afraid of the piece going viral and triggering the victim's memories and she also was afraid that all this work and getting them to recollect traumatic events would amount to nothing if it didn't blow up. She felt that she was the only one grappling with all these consequences and nuanced areas of having interviewees with trauma, even trauma they might not even be aware of themselves. She says that she had to go into counselling and it's important to note that it's not just fun and games to go viral.

          <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#faq11" class="collapsed">On our end as we're going through this journey of pursuing journalism there really isn't much training on dealing with interviewees, how did you build up your techniques and expertise?<i class="icofont-simple-up"></i></a>
          <div id="faq11" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
            There isn't much training in schools because in classes they just teach you what are good questions to ask. They don't really teach the relationship management part, like how to get a person comfortable within 5 minutes when you only have 15 min to talk to them, how to get someone to open up over Zoom, should you meet them once for coffee. Techniques she had to navigate herself, no one really taught her. Things like sitting beside someone instead of opposite them when they're unsure of sharing things with you. She also has been learning from her therapist. Getting counselling skills helps her to talk to her interviewees because it teaches understanding and empathy skills. Getting counselling at diff points in her career has helped. Listen, not judge, have empathy, try to understand the situation, try not to project your own feelings when you talk to them, it's not your role as a journalist to judge them. Both of your interviewee should be authentic, doesn't matter what your interviewee's personality is like, shouldn't try to mirror the interviewee's personality because the interviewee can tell when you're being authentic.

          <div id="faq12" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
            She applied for a job as a digital writer at Cleo Always come prepared with a list of questions and a list of focal points. She never wings it. Know when to change your questions and ask for more details on certain things, the interview questions shouldn't be fixed, not strict about sticking w the questions. Sometimes need to follow their train of thought. Think of it not as a back and forth but a conversation with your friend (ofc it's harder when it's a short interview but then the expectations will be diff bc then it wouldn't be a profound piece). Just be very aware that the interviewee is not just your interview subject but another human with their own thoughts and struggles.

          <div id="faq13" class="collapse" data-parent=".faq-list">
            Depends on the company. Working together as a team is very important as a journalists, esp in her current job, don't just see it as writing. For eg you may have a lead and somebody else is good at visuals, can ask them to come on board. She feels that competition will be in every job and it's impt because it drives us as human beings. It's impt to find the right kind of bosses, mentor and supervisors in the industry. She says it's important to speak to people from the different companies to understand the working culture, some places can be more individualistic. Looking for job, at the start of the career, maybe more about the jobscope but from the second job onwards maybe more about the mentors and bosses. Keep close friends outside the industry, not just from the media industry as the media industry tends to be an echo chamber.

            Impt to stay in touch in the community, really embed yourself in the different social media communities whether it's Reddit, Tiktok Instagram, Facebook or Clubhouse. Really be in the apps and comments, and she says basically your life has to be really on it. For eg her own exp she did a report on online gambling and she actually went on a Facebook group with CS go players to find people to interview. Finding out about longer social trends. Taylor Lorenz, NYT reporter, reported on Ok boomer and Gamestop, the reporter that Grace looks to about social phenomena and trends, Grace recommends to study the way Taylor writes about it.

            Every day is different. Some days she can be making calls to potential interviewees or getting coffee with them or doing interviews, some days are just spent writing, some days she just researches to find inspiration and leads. She says to embed herself in the different online communities to get a good look at different interesting stories, that's where she gets her inspiration from. She says life as a journalist means that you might have to live your life around the interviewee's time.
